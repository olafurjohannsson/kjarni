**Local embeddings, semantic search, classification, reranking and chat for C#, Go, Rust, Python, C++ and the command line.**

Kjarni is a native inference engine written from scratch in Rust. It ships as a single shared library, downloads its own models, and runs entirely on your machine.

## Try it in 30 seconds

**Nothing to install:** the [browser demo](https://kjarni.ai/demo) runs the engine in your own tab.

**Or one command, and it works:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://kjarni.ai/install.sh | sh    # Windows: irm https://kjarni.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

```console
$ kjarni classify "This is wonderful"
  ✓       POSITIVE  ████████████████████  100.0%
          NEGATIVE  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░    0.0%

$ kjarni similarity "doctor" "physician"
  █████████████████░░░   86.0%  highly similar

$ echo "Great service" | kjarni classify --format json | jq -r '.label'
POSITIVE
```

The model downloads on first use and is cached. Everything after that works offline.

**In your own code**, it is the same three lines in every language:

```csharp
using var embedder = new Embedder("minilm-l6-v2");
Console.WriteLine(embedder.Similarity("doctor", "physician"));   // 0.8598
```

```bash
dotnet add package Kjarni                             # C# / .NET
go get github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni-go@latest   # Go
```

[Every language below](#install), including C++ and the browser.

<sub>The name is Icelandic [ˈkʰjartnɪ]. It means "core."</sub>

## Install

**C# / .NET** — [nuget.org/packages/Kjarni](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kjarni)

```bash
dotnet add package Kjarni
```

**Go** — [pkg.go.dev/github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni-go)

```bash
go get github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni-go@latest
```

**CLI**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://kjarni.ai/install.sh | sh    # Linux / macOS
irm https://kjarni.ai/install.ps1 | iex         # Windows
```

**Python** *(pre-release)*

```bash
pip install --pre kjarni
```

**Rust** *(pre-release)*

```bash
cargo add kjarni@0.0.1-alpha.1
```

**C++** — download the archive for your platform from [releases](https://github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni/releases). It contains the shared library, `kjarni.h` (the C ABI) and `kjarni.hpp` (a header-only C++23 wrapper with RAII handles and `std::expected` errors).

```bash
tar -xzf kjarni-x86_64-linux.tar.gz -C kjarni/
g++ -std=c++23 main.cpp -Ikjarni -Lkjarni -lkjarni_ffi -o app
```

**Browser (WebAssembly)** — [npmjs.com/package/kjarni-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kjarni-wasm)

```bash
npm i kjarni-wasm
```

Or without a bundler, straight from a CDN:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Kjarni } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kjarni-wasm/dist/index.js";
</script>
```

The package runs inference in a Web Worker, so loading a model or generating a reply never freezes the page. The raw wasm-bindgen bundle is also in `kjarni-wasm.tar.gz` on [releases](https://github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni/releases) if you would rather drive it yourself.

Models for the browser are packed as `.kjq`, a single file holding config, tokenizer and int8 weights. See [the format guide](crates/kjarni-wasm/scripts/README.md) for how to make your own.

Models download on first use and are cached in `~/.cache/kjarni` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\kjarni` on Windows). No configuration required.

## The same thing in every language

Semantic similarity, the smallest useful program, in each binding.

**C#**

```csharp
using var embedder = new Embedder("minilm-l6-v2");
Console.WriteLine(embedder.Similarity("doctor", "physician"));   // 0.8598
```

**C++**

```cpp
#include "kjarni.hpp"

auto embedder = kjarni::Embedder::create({.model = "minilm-l6-v2"});
auto a = embedder->encode("doctor");
auto b = embedder->encode("physician");
std::println("{:.4f}", kjarni::cosine(*a, *b));                  // 0.8598
```

**Go**

```go
e, _ := kjarni.NewEmbedder("minilm-l6-v2")
defer e.Close()
sim, _ := e.Similarity("doctor", "physician")
fmt.Println(sim)                                                 // 0.8598
```

**Python** *(pre-release)*

```python
from kjarni import Classifier

classifier = Classifier("distilbert-sentiment")
print(classifier.classify("i love kjarni").label)                # positive
```

**Rust** *(pre-release)*

```rust
let result = classifier::classify("distilbert-sentiment", "I love this product!").await?;
println!("{} ({:.1}%)", result.label, result.score * 100.0);
```

**Browser**

```js
import { Kjarni } from "kjarni-wasm";

const kjarni = await Kjarni.load({ encoder: "/models/minilm-l6-v2-q8.kjq" });
console.log(await kjarni.similarity("doctor", "physician"));   // 0.8598
```

**CLI**

```bash
kjarni embed "doctor" --format json
echo "I love this product" | kjarni classify
```

## Why Kjarni exists

Adding semantic search or classification to a .NET or Go application usually means standing up a Python service, shipping a 2GB PyTorch image, or exporting models to ONNX and hand-writing the tokenization and pooling around them. If your data cannot leave the building — legal, healthcare, defense, finance — the hosted-API path is closed to you entirely.

Kjarni is a single `.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib` that runs inside your process, with predictable behavior and no external infrastructure.

## How it compares

|                              | **Kjarni** | ONNX Runtime | sentence-transformers | fastembed |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| Setup steps                  | 1 (add package) | Runtime + export each model | Python + PyTorch + model | Python + onnxruntime |
| Python runtime required      | **No**     | No           | Yes                   | Yes       |
| Model conversion step        | **None**   | `.onnx` export required | None        | None      |
| First-class C# API           | **Yes**    | Low-level tensors only | No             | No        |
| First-class Go API           | **Yes**    | Third-party cgo wrappers | No           | No        |
| Tokenization included        | **Yes**    | Bring your own | Yes                  | Yes       |
| Pooling / normalization      | **Yes**    | Bring your own | Yes                  | Yes       |
| Built-in hybrid search (BM25 + vector) | **Yes** | No | No                | No        |
| Built-in cross-encoder rerank | **Yes**   | No           | Separate model plumbing | Limited |
| Runs in the browser (WASM)   | **Yes**    | Yes (ort-web) | No                   | No        |
| GPU                          | WebGPU (Vulkan / DX12 / Metal) | CUDA, DirectML, others | CUDA | No |
| Runtime dependency footprint | glibc 2.17 | ONNX Runtime native libs | ~2 GB       | onnxruntime |
| License                      | MIT / Apache-2.0 | MIT     | Apache-2.0            | Apache-2.0 |

ONNX Runtime is a general-purpose tensor executor and does that job well. Kjarni is task-level: you ask for an embedding or a ranking, not for a graph execution. That is the difference the table is describing.

## Verified against PyTorch

Kjarni's outputs are tested for numerical parity against PyTorch/HuggingFace golden values, and its GPU path is tested for parity against its own CPU path — encoders, cross-encoders, decoders, RoPE, RMSNorm, and full generation traces:

```
test models::sentence_encoder::...::test_torch_sentence_encoder_golden_values ... ok
test models::sequence_classifier::...::test_cross_encoder_rerank_torch_parity ... ok
test tests::encoder_parity_test::test_encoder_cpu_gpu_parity                   ... ok
test tests::decoder_parity_test::test_full_text_generation_parity              ... ok

test result: ok. 44 passed; 0 failed
```

A reimplemented engine is only worth using if it agrees with the reference implementation. These tests are how that claim is kept honest.

## What it does

### Embeddings

```csharp
using var embedder = new Embedder("minilm-l6-v2");
float[] vector = embedder.Encode("Hello world");        // 384 dims
float[][] batch = embedder.EncodeBatch(documents);
float sim      = embedder.Similarity("doctor", "physician");
```

```go
e, _ := kjarni.NewEmbedder("minilm-l6-v2")
defer e.Close()
vector, _ := e.Embed("Hello world")
sim, _    := e.Similarity("doctor", "physician")
```

### Semantic search over your own documents

Indexing and hybrid retrieval are built in — there is no separate vector database to run.

```csharp
using var indexer = new Indexer(model: "minilm-l6-v2", quiet: true);
indexer.Create("my_index", new[] { "docs/" });

using var searcher = new Searcher(
    model: "minilm-l6-v2",
    rerankerModel: "minilm-l6-v2-cross-encoder");

foreach (var r in searcher.Search("my_index", "how do returns work?", mode: SearchMode.Hybrid))
    Console.WriteLine($"{r.Score:F4}  {r.Text}");
```

Search modes: `Semantic` (vector), `Keyword` (BM25), `Hybrid` (both, fused).

### Reranking

```csharp
using var reranker = new Reranker("minilm-l6-v2-cross-encoder");
var ranked = reranker.Rank(query, candidates);
```

### Classification

```csharp
using var classifier = new Classifier("roberta-sentiment");
Console.WriteLine(classifier.Classify("I love this product!"));
// positive (98.5%)

using var toxic = new Classifier("toxic-bert");
Console.WriteLine(toxic.Classify("You are an idiot").ToDetailedString());
```

### From the command line

The CLI exposes the same capabilities, reads from stdin, and writes JSON — so it pipes like any UNIX tool.

```bash
$ kjarni classify "Best purchase ever"
  ✓       POSITIVE  ████████████████████  100.0%
          NEGATIVE  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░    0.0%

$ echo "Great service" | kjarni classify --format json | jq -r '.label'
POSITIVE

$ kjarni index create my-docs docs/*
✓ Indexed 15 documents (39.52 KB)

$ kjarni search my-docs "keeping data safe" --top-k 3
  1. cryptography.txt
     ████████████████████  100.0%
     "Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography protect digital communications by…"

  2. tcpip.txt
     ██████████░░░░░░░░░░   49.2%
     "TCP/IP is a layered protocol suite that enables reliable data transmiss…"

$ kjarni similarity "doctor" "physician"
  █████████████████░░░   86.0%  highly similar
```

`kjarni model list` shows the full catalog, including the decoder LLMs (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, Phi-3.5, DeepSeek-R1) the engine supports. Text generation runs through the same engine, in C#, Rust, the CLI and the browser. If raw single-model generation throughput is what you are optimising for, [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is more specialised. Kjarni's lane is breadth of language and deployment rather than raw generation speed: the same engine behind a NuGet package, a Go module, a C header, a CLI binary and a WASM bundle.

## FAQ

### Does it need Python?

No. Kjarni is a Rust library compiled to a native shared object. There is no Python interpreter, no PyTorch, and no `transformers` package involved at any point. The optional Python *binding* lets you call Kjarni from Python — it does not make Python a dependency of the engine.

### Does it work offline or air-gapped?

Yes. Models are downloaded once and cached on disk; after that, nothing touches the network. For a fully air-gapped install, pre-populate the cache directory (or point `KJARNI_CACHE_DIR` at it) and the engine never attempts a connection. No telemetry is collected.

### Is a GPU required?

No. Every capability runs on CPU with hand-tuned SIMD kernels (AVX2/FMA on x86, NEON on ARM). GPU acceleration is optional and uses WebGPU — Vulkan on Linux, DX12 or Vulkan on Windows, Metal on macOS. CUDA is not required and not used.

### How does it compare to ONNX Runtime?

ONNX Runtime executes a computation graph; you supply the tokenization, the pooling, the normalization, and an exported `.onnx` file for every model. Kjarni is task-level: `Encode(text)` returns a finished, normalized embedding, and models are referenced by name with no export step. Kjarni also includes indexing, BM25, hybrid fusion, and cross-encoder reranking, which ONNX Runtime leaves to you. If you need to run arbitrary models from arbitrary frameworks, use ONNX Runtime. If you need embeddings and search in a .NET or Go application, Kjarni is considerably less work.

### Can I use it as a vector database?

For small to medium corpora, yes — the built-in index handles storage, BM25, vector search, and hybrid fusion with no separate service. It is designed as the SQLite of local semantic search, not as a replacement for a distributed vector store at hundreds of millions of vectors.

### Does it run in the browser?

Yes. The encoder path compiles to WebAssembly and runs client-side, which means text never leaves the user's machine — it powers the [Obsidian semantic-search plugin](https://github.com/olafurjohannsson/kjarni), which does all of its indexing and querying locally in the browser runtime.

### Which platforms are supported?

| Platform | CPU | GPU | Status |
| -------- | --- | --- | ------ |
| Linux x64 | Yes | Yes (Vulkan) | Tested in CI |
| Linux ARM64 | Yes | Yes (Vulkan) | Built in CI |
| Windows x64 | Yes | Yes (DX12 / Vulkan) | Built in CI |
| macOS ARM64 | Yes | Metal | Binaries published; test coverage in progress |
| WebAssembly | Yes | n/a | Embeddings, classification, reranking, search, chat |

The only system dependency on Linux is glibc 2.17 or newer.

### What license is it under?

MIT or Apache-2.0, at your option — including commercial and on-premise use.

## How it works

Kjarni does not wrap ONNX, LibTorch, or any external inference engine. The runtime is written in Rust from scratch.

- Hand-tuned SIMD kernels (AVX2/FMA, NEON)
- Custom WGSL compute shaders for GPU inference
- Zero-copy model loading via mmap
- BF16 compute path
- Quantization: Q4, Q6, Q8
- Single shared library, no runtime linkage beyond libc
